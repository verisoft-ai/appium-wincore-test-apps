// Builds the bespoke DevExpress WinForms grid fixture (devexpress-grid-ownerdraw/) used
// by test/e2e/dotnet-bridge-attach.e2e.ts. Checked into this repo as source (unlike other test
// fixtures elsewhere in this file's git history) rather than cloned from a DevExpress-Examples
// repo — two cloned examples (a WPF TreeList, then a WinForms XtraTreeList) both turned out to
// already be visible to plain UIA via DevExpress's own AccessibleObject support, which defeats the
// purpose of a fixture meant to prove the bridge does something. This fixture's "Status" column is
// deliberately unbound and rendered entirely inside GridView.CustomDrawCell — its real text
// (Healthy/Degraded/Offline) never enters DevExpress's normal cell-value pipeline, so nothing
// exposes it via Name, the Value pattern, or HelpText. Confirmed empirically: plain UIA only sees
// a generic "Status row N" placeholder for that column.
//
// Requires the DevExpress_License env var to be set to your license key text (a free 30-day
// trial key is enough — see Client Center > Downloads > your license key string, after
// https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/405494/trial-register/set-up-your-dev-express-license-key).
// DevExpress_License / DevExpress_LicensePath are their own documented env var names (exact
// casing matters) — not a repo-specific convention. Without one set, the build still succeeds
// (DevExpress emits a DX1000 evaluation-watermark warning, not a hard failure) since this is a
// bespoke fixture, not a redistributed DevExpress example — but the running app pops an "About
// DevExpress" trial nag dialog on launch that test/e2e/helpers/session.ts's launcher must dismiss.
